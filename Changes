         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - Rename dist/module from Alt::Module::Path::SHARYANTO to
           SHARYANTO::Module::Path because I want to depend on this module on

           Module::Path by installing this dist).

         - Change interface (using hash argument) so it becomes standard Rinci
           stuff.

         [REMOVED FEATURES]

         - Remove command-line script 'mpath' to avoid clash with the one from
           Module-Path. Will replace with App-PMUtils' pmpath.
